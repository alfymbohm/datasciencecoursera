Where the data-science magic will happen!

## Proof that I'm learning Markdown
See I can format things in *italic*, **bold**, _underline_, `monospace, i.e. code format`, ~~strikethrough~~.  
I can add a [hyperlink](coursera.org) 
And I know how to do lists both  
* unordered
* (it adds another bullet if you just do carriage return, awesome!)  
and  
1. ordered
2. (does the same for this type of list too!)

And there's an easter egg just below if you look at my code...  
[]: # ((empty) link labels give you the opportunity to add comments to your markdown!)
